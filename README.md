# fpf

FPF (Form Population Filter) is a library designed to help with the population of form values and error message insertion.

Examples (and documentation) can be found [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/saracen/fpf) to give a sense of scenarios where it is useful. But essentially, if you want to provide feedback to a user after they've submitted a form incorrectly, FPF can do that, independent from any template engine you've used.
